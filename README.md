# TouchGFX_API_Project

********************************Project Ideas********************************
For my intitial thougths, I'm thinking of using a mixture of a Rasperry Pi4 
and an ARM based MCU, that has driver/Interface support for a TouchGFX screen 
that is similar to a smartphone, or Smartwatch. My initial thoughts is to use 
the Rasperry Pi 4, for the puplic API and packing the data and transmitting 
it over QSPI, to the Arm MCU, which will then display the image on the 
TouchGFX.
